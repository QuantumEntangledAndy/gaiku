# Gaiku

[2d](gaiku-2d) and [3d](gaiku-3d) Terrain engine. The purpose of the gaiku is to provide a 
foundation to build your games easily without worring about implementing your own engine.

The main crate is developed game engine agnostic, so we can help to reach more developers.

## Supported game engines

- [Amethyst](gaiku-amethyst)
